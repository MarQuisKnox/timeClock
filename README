<h1>Attention:</h1>
This doesn't work at all right now. Will fix it when I have time.


Overview:

'timeClock' is a script written in PHP to track the number of hours worked per day.
It is designed for a single person.  I created this script to track my own 
work hours, because I could not find a suitable open source script that 
functioned the way I wanted.
